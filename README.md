# Colorful Language

Colorful Language is a simple Flutter app that displays a changing background color and text in different languages. It demonstrates basic features of the Flutter framework, such as stateful widgets, timers, and gesture detection.

## Features

- Randomly changes the background color of the screen to a new RGB value every 3 seconds
- Adjusts the color of the text based on the luminance of the background color to ensure contrast
- Changes the displayed language when the user taps on the screen
- Supports multiple languages out of the box, including English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Ukrainian

## Usage

To run the app, you'll need to have Flutter installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to launch the app on an emulator or connected device

When the app starts, you should see a screen with a randomly generated background color and a text that says "Привіт!" in Ukrainian. Every 3 seconds, the background color will change to a new random color, and the text will switch to a new language from the list of supported languages. To change the language manually, you can tap anywhere on the screen.
